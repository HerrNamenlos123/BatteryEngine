# BatteryEngine

This is a simple framework for Windows desktop applications or small games, based on Allegro5. It allows low-level programming and direct access to OpenGL. It is very easy to use the GPU by providing custom GLSL shaders.

## Requirements

 - [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - For cloning, obviously
 - [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/) - Other IDEs can be used by altering `generate-win.bat`

## How to use

 - `git clone https://github.com/HerrNamenlos123/BatteryEngine.git --recursive`
 - Doubleclick `generate-win.bat` and build the project `INSTALL_ALL`
 - Now the framework is ready to use, [here is a template on how to use it](https://github.com/HerrNamenlos123/BatteryTemplateProject)

Additionally:
When files are added, simply re-run `generate-win.bat` to add them to the Solution explorer.
